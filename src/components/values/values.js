                                We adhere strongly, but not dogmatically, to the tenants of the Agile Manifesto, Twelve
                                Principles of
                                Agile
                                Software, and Five Values of Extreme Programming. We adapt our process to minimize
                                ceremony and maximize
                                communication, efficiency and happiness.

                                We are pragmatic idealists. We believe in continually evolving towards a set of ideals
                                and dream of all
                                the
                                possibilities they can bring. We understand there isn’t a silver bullet and are willing
                                to make
                                concessions
                                to those ideals and pragmatism when they conflict with current business needs. Ideals
                                define our long
                                term
                                strategies. Pragmatism defines our day-to-day tactics. Our ideals and business needs are
                                constantly
                                evolving
                                and we adjust accordingly.

                                We make practical (often boring) technology choices. We don’t build science projects
                                just because we are
                                smart enough to build them. New technologies should be chosen based on the merits of
                                solving the problem
                                at

                                We believe that many problems can be addressed through better communication. We do not
                                hoard
                                information.
                                We
                                share our process and ideals freely and openly. We strive to be fearlessly transparent
                                with ourselves,
                                our
                                team members, and our clients.

                                We check our egos at the door. A codebase is owned by all team members, from the best
                                features, and most
                                elegant implementations, to the worst bugs. We make mistakes sometimes, because we’re
                                human, but rather
                                than
                                dwell on them we choose to fix and then learn from them.
